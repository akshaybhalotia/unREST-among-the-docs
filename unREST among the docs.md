- problem
- docs are hard
  - give info
  - in an easily readable manner
  - in an easily findable manner
  - help with the next steps
  - give them enough
  - don't make them come back
- what is harder
  - documenting frontend SDKs
  - documenting UI features
  - with version control
  - feature based releases, without a release cycle
  - breaking changes
